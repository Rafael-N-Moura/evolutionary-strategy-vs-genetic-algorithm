Description:

Dimensions: d

The Ackley function is widely used for testing optimization algorithms. In its two-dimensional form, as shown in the plot above, it is characterized by a nearly flat outer region, and a large hole at the centre. The function poses a risk for optimization algorithms, particularly hillclimbing algorithms, to be trapped in one of its many local minima.

Recommended variable values are: a = 20, b = 0.2 and c = 2π.

Input Domain:

The function is usually evaluated on the hypercube xi ∈ [-32.768, 32.768], for all i = 1, …, d, although it may also be restricted to a smaller domain.

Global Minimum:
f(x*) = 0, at x* = (0,...,0)
