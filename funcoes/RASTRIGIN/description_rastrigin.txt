Description:

Dimensions: d

The Rastrigin function has several local minima. It is highly multimodal, but locations of the minima are regularly distributed. It is shown in the plot above in its two-dimensional form.

Input Domain:

The function is usually evaluated on the hypercube xi ∈ [-5.12, 5.12], for all i = 1, …, d.

Global Minimum:
f(x*) = 0, at x* = (0,...,0)
