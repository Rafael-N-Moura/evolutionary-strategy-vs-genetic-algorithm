Description:

Dimensions: d

The Rosenbrock function, also referred to as the Valley or Banana function, is a popular test problem for gradient-based optimization algorithms. It is shown in the plot above in its two-dimensional form.

The function is unimodal, and the global minimum lies in a narrow, parabolic valley. However, even though this valley is easy to find, convergence to the minimum is difficult (Picheny et al., 2012).

Input Domain:

The function is usually evaluated on the hypercube xi ∈ [-5, 10], for all i = 1, …, d, although it may be restricted to the hypercube xi ∈ [-2.048, 2.048], for all i = 1, …, d.

Global Minimum:
f(x*) = 0, at x* = (1,...,1)
