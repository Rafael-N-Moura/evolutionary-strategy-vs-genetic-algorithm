Description:

Dimensions: d

The Schwefel function is complex, with many local minima. The plot shows the two-dimensional form of the function.

Input Domain:

The function is usually evaluated on the hypercube xi ∈ [-500, 500], for all i = 1, …, d.

Global Minimum:
f(x*) = 0, at x* = (420.9687,...,420.9687)
